Algorithm Challenge #9 – Print the Frequency of All Digits in a Number
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer and prints how many times each digit (0–9) appears in that number.
Only digits with a frequency greater than zero are displayed.

This algorithm reinforces digit extraction, nested logic, and structured iteration.

💡 What You’ll Learn
--
How to extract digits using modulo and integer division

How to loop through all digits (0–9)

How to compute individual digit frequencies

How to skip unused digits cleanly

Strengthening arithmetic-based algorithmic logic

🧩 Example
--
Input:

Please enter the number: 1223222

Output:

Digit 1 Frequency is 1 Time(s)

Digit 2 Frequency is 5 Time(s)

Digit 3 Frequency is 1 Time(s)

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: digits_full_frequency.cpp

Challenge Number: #9

💬 Notes
-
This algorithm teaches an efficient non-string approach to digit analysis using pure arithmetic.
It’s commonly used in digital analysis, number theory, and competitive programming.
